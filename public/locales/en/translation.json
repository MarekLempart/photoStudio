I am fascinated by all the snippets of reality that can be captured in an image. I most enjoy photographing people – especially when they allow themselves to be themselves. This happens often in my sessions :). The most difficult art in photography is the portrait – it requires getting between the skin and the shirt of the person being photographed.
